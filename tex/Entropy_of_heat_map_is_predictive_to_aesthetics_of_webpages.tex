\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Aesthetics are important factors for engaging users in browsing a website. Big data reveal that most visitors will determine whether stay on or leave a webpage in just a few seconds after landing [Weibull distribution]. Appealing webpages make visters feel more trustworthy [11, 22]. Tractinsky et al. (2000) claims that the beautiful webpages are seemingly more usable.\\
Aesthetic is rooted in the Greek term for "to perceive." Our vision system, the eye and the connected cortex behind, enables us to perceive and cognize the beauty around us. An eye, behaves like a spotlight [The term "spotlight" was inspired by the work of William James, who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe.[6] ], has a very narrow but very high-resolution foveal vision surrounded with a broader but much lower resolution peripheral area. our subtle attention mechanism determines where our spotlight move toward and upon, targeting things like faces, words, images on screens, and a variety of other meaningful objects, bringing salient details into the focus and filtering out background clutter. The spotlight keeps glancing from one spot to another and piecing all snapshots together to give an overall impression of the scene to our brain.\\
eye tracking devices are designed to recording our fixations (gaze) and saccades (eye movements). In usability and marketing research. Designers of visual communication material want their material to attract and retain attention. Eye tracking has been used in evaluating quality of user interfaces largely to assess the accessibility of key information. Though useful, this is a fairly limited measure of user experience [].\\
Is it possible use the eye tracker as a mind reader to guess observers’ aesthetic satisfactions to a webpage? We expect that eye tracking devices may enable us some new sense of beauty in the eye of the beholder.\\
In this paper, a new\\

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel}
It is a natural thought that our eye’s attentional responses may somehow reflect our sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object.\\
To examine how eye movements relate to judging aesthetically pleasing works of art, Berlyne (1971) concluded that aesthetic evaluations are based on two types of visual exploration, one is global diverse exploration and the other is local specific information gathering. The diverse exploration is characterized by long saccades and short fixation (gaze) durations, while specific information gathering has longer fixation durations and shorter saccades. Berlyne proposed that the pattern of exploration, featured by the oscillation of the durations and saccade lengths, is crucial for judging images as aesthetically pleasing or not. Berlyne's concept of visual exploration gives a theoretical framework influential to the following studies in this area.\\
Locher(2006). Demonstrates that simply altering the color-balance of the original abstract compositions will change the distribution of gaze and scan path.\\
difference in the distribution of the gaze existed between the three versions of each compositioempirical evidence that affected the way viewers attention and cognitive processes that occur during an aesthetic episode visually
Franke et al. 2008 investigated people’s aesthetic preferences to the 3-D graphic rendering with single- versus multi-perspectives. A clear perceptual bias towards multi-perspective images was found. An additional eye tracking study revealed an increased number of fixations and longer dwell times on multi-perspective images.\\
Plumhoff and Schirillo 2009 use eye tracking to discern if unconscious eye movements were related to the phenomenon of “oblique effect” (Latto et al, 2000 Perception 29 981 \^ 987). (The effect claims that observers prefer originally oriented Mondrian's painting to their rotated versions.) They observed that with the pleasant images, the fixation durations over the viewing period are increasing and the saccade lengths are fluctuating more compared to the unpleasant.\\
Wallraven et al. 2009, analyzed eye tracking data from 20 participants, who looked at 275 artworks of different periods of styles, found a strong effect of art period on both number and duration of fixations. For instance, they found that Postmodernist and Classicist images received less and at the same time longer lasting fixations than the Surrealist paintings.\\
Massaro et al 2012 use deliberately categorized ( color, grey, human and nature) of art paintings as test material to investigate the contributions of bottom-up and top-down processes of visual attention in the first stages of eye scanning on the art paintings. They checked some extra indexes of AOI (area of interests) such as the number of AOIs, the number of fixations in first AOIs, time to first AOI and so on, besides the indexes of the number and duration of fixation.\\
Khalighy et.al 2015 developed an empirical aesthetic formula by conducting three eye-tracking experiments on simple geometric forms of stimuli. He conclude that beauty are positively related to the product of the number of fixations and standard deviation of duration.\\
The reported empirical evidences so far have revealed the potential of eye tracking in study of aesthetics. Researchers use artworks or computer graphics as stimuli, observe and analyze the variations in eye tracking data. Eye tracker became a new apparatus for experimental aesthetics.\\
The indexes mentioned above are generally simple statistics of raw data. They are used to simply describe the users’ eye behavior, such as the increased number of fixations, longer duration and oscillation of the durations and saccade lengths, and so on. Most interpretations and conclusions remain at phenomenon level. Most of the evidences can only be interpreted that for good pages users’ eyes are more active and dynamic. There is no obeservation can give us an in-depth convincing interpretation about the mechanism of our aesthetic response.\\
there is still quite few research using eye tracking data to quantitatively evaluate user aesthetic experience of browsing a webpage. in web design practices. The data are generally visualized to provide an intuitive and qualitative view of accessibility or personal/group interest bias to specific objects on a web page, not the aesthetic experience. Even those analytical indexes we have mentioned above are rarely used in the evaluations    No quantitative metric\\
Researchers in web aesthetics so far mainly focuses on finding predictive features of webpage per se. it is an interdisciplinary topic across psychological [] and computational research domains [] . Some promising progresses have made in this direction. Ivory and Sinha [16] Zheng et al. [38] reneick etal use low level image features to predict perceived visual complexity and colorfulness and find the two models are largely correlated to peoples aesthetic preferences.\\
Can eye tracking provides a more general means of quantifying aesthetic aspects of a viewer’s experience? Though some interesting experimental results have been reported. Proven quantitative links between eye movements and aesthetics however are still lacking.\\
We need a deep mining of the tracking data and more informative index,\\


\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:hyp}
Our idea Inspired from the fluency hypothesis. Reber et al propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties: The more fluently perceivers can process an object, the more positive their aesthetic response.\\
Viewing a webpage is essentially a procedure of image processing in human visual system.\\
How to evaluate the fluency of visual processing objectively？ It could be started from our eye behavior of attention, which serves as a precursor to all other neurological/cognitive functions.\\
Then, how to evaluate the fluency of visual attention? We believe this could be observed in our eye movement behaviors.\\
At its most basic, attention is defined as the process by which we select a subset from all of the available information for further processing. So attention keep alerting and selecting targets in bottom up (visual saliences) and top down ( interesting thing) ways.\\
So, the fluent attentional process may have:\\
less difficulty/ uncertainty in competitive selection, which is the process determining which information gains access to working memory. This means less conflict between multiple attention cues.\\
Less distraction in orienting and localizing attention on interesting and informative objects.\\
We expect those could be observed from two aspects of visual tracking data:\\
Saccades sequence, Especially large saccades among AOIs―the gaze transition process among objects, Represents how complex our attention shifts.\\
Fixation distribution, represents how scatter and chaos of our attention allocated on those objects\\
And more importantly,\\
This paper我们采用眼动熵作为一种视觉流畅性的度量, 并考察其美感的预测，并与其它指标进行比较。\\
不难发现，常见的眼动指标大都旨在通过不同的维度表现眼动的属性，可能是沿时间来展开，如首达时间、持续时间，可能是沿空间来展开如热图，AOI。\\
如何来研究眼动的流畅性，评估眼动注意的负载尚无有效指标\\

\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:exp}
The experiment simulates the natural accidental landings of websites. The only unnatural part of the experiment is the form we called Time-limited Exploration. That means the experiment forces/encourages the observers to do quick general explorations rather than specific information gatherings on the pages. After three pages of adaptive testing in advance, the observers should aware that they only have a few seconds to view each of the pages displayed. This is reasonable as we already knew, users are used to make a quick decision whether they stay or leave in first seconds after landing a new page, to avoid wasting more time than necessary on bad pages.
The restricted exposure time must be enough to allow us to examine the early unintentional gazing behavior, meanwhile reducing the fatigue of the observer.\\
\subsection{Equipment}
The eye tracker we used is a Tobii T50 that works with Tobii Studio 9 software. The eye tracker resolution is 1280 * 1024 pixel.\\
\subsection{Materials}
We select 40 website main pages snapshots as the testing material. To make the webpages more representative to good or bad in aesthetic quality. We sample pages from （*）一个评选优秀网页设计的网站和一个评选丑陋网页设计的网站（www.websitesfromhell.com）， and only select the odd number pages in the collections.\\
pages that contain non-Latin characters or well recognized logos and faces are removed, to avoided interference of non-aesthetic social opinions. Finally, we get 20 webpages from each site. All pages are snapshotted in landscape form with resolution 1280*800 pixels to match the window of eye tracker. The snapshots include the frame of web browser. Figure xx is all the pages used as the stimuli.\\
All the pages used in our eye tracking test. Arranged According to the score, from low to high.
\subsection{Subjects}
A total of 30 subjects (13 men, 17 women) participated in eye movement experiments. They are students or teachers from some departments in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Some of them are foreign students from South Korea. Aged between 19 and 27 years old.\\
\subsection{Site}
Setting the experiment conduct in a quiet room. The curtains of the room were pulled up to avoid uncontrollable light and reflection on screen. During the eye tracking, there was no interaction between the operator and the subjects. The eye tracker was placed in front of a pure White wall, to avoid possible distractions.\\
For each subject, the eye tracking test was conducted at first. A subject was instructed to browse these pages in a relaxed manner just as usual mindless wandering on the web. In order to reduce the fatigue effect, the test was divided into two phases with a minute of rest in between. in each phase the screen of the tracker automatically displayed half of total 40 experimental pages in a random order. each page was only lighted up for 3 seconds, followed with 1 second black screen. three dummy pages were placed at the beginning of the first phase as the adaptive test to make them feel comfortable with the rhythm of the test.\\
During the test each subject was settled in a comfort chair, and head position was fixed with a soft support in 60 inches distance from the eye tracker screen. the hands rested on the table with a mouse in one hand, though the clicking and scrolling were not responding.\\
the subjective ratings of the pages were arranged separately after the experiment. The subjects reviewed the 40 experimental pages once again with no time limit. The subjects were asked to judge  an aesthetic quality  of "good" or "bad" for each page.\\
And all subjects confirmed the pages they saw in the test had never seen before.\\
\subsection{data collection}
Each page in the test will get a final score based on how many good or bad it have got. The figure xx is the distribution of page on scores.\\
the distribution is apparently bimodal. The 20 pages with score less than 0.5 are exactly same pages collected from the www. In other words, this 20 pages were recognized as "bad" pages without any doubt.\\
T50 collect the eye focus on the screen in the frequency of 50Hz, and through interpolation to get the speeds of the eye movement at all times, then to estimate where the fixation gaze happens.\\
The raw data produced by the eye tracker is consisted a series of gazes/fixations. Each fixation contain four parameters: the start time, the duration, position X and Y on the screen. All of our analysis below comes from these original eye-tracking data based on fixations.\\

\subsection{Traditional statistical indexes}
First of all, we analyze the data using some traditional indexes of eye tracking research. Most of them have been used in various situations of the aesthetics researches reviewed in section 2.\\
The indexes we will use include\\
num of fixation，mean of duration，std of duration，mean of saccade length、std of saccade length、num of AOI、mean of AOI fixNum、std of AOI fixNum\\
Areas of Interests (AOIs) are spatial clusters of the fixations on the pages, we uses the default AOI clustering algorithm in the Tobii Studio package. Figure xx is an AOI example obtained by the clustering.\\

  mean of saccade length & -0.2203 & 0.0871 \\
  std of saccade length & -0.1933 & 0.2732 \\

  std of AOI fixNum & 0.2556 & 0.0991 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\\
The results of the analysis are listed in table xxx. Each index has a linear correlation value with the aesthetic scores, and a p-value of anova test separating the good and bad two classes.
The results show that only Number of fixations is barely passed the anova test. P<0.05, all other indexes are failed in the anova test. The number of fixations has a weak positive correlation with the page aesthetics, representing the nice pages generally get more of gazes, implying the eyes are more active. Meanwhile, the Number of AOI has a week negative correlation with the page aesthetics, representing the good page’s fixations are more concentrated on fewer AOI. It may also imply subjects are more swiftly entering the stage of specific information gathering [  ]\\
\subsection{Entropies in our glancing behaviors}
The existing definition of entropy includes thermodynamics and information theory, conceptual, entropy represents a system’s chaos, degree of confusion, or vice versa, order and certainty.
The concept of visual entropy actually expresses the determinism of peoples’ eye movements in spatial and temporal dimensions. A smaller visual entropy may indicate a more fluent and concentrated visual process.\\
The visual entropies defined in this paper a based on the Shannon entropy of information. The entropy is a measure of the uncertainty based on the probabilities of all possible events.\\
For a discrete random variable X with probability spaces Ω = {x1, ..., xn} and probability distribution P (X). The information entropy H (the Greek letter eta) is defined as H (X) = -ΣP (xi) log2 P(xi). The higher the degree of H (X), the higher the degree of chaos on the distribution of X, the greater the amount of uncertainty, whereas the smaller the H (X), the more ordered the distribution of X and the smaller the amount of uncertainty.\\
Now we analyze the visual entropies from two aspects of the eye tracking data: large saccades (transitions) among AOIs and fixation distribution.\\
\subsection{Entropy in gaze transition}
Entropy of eye movements was first introduced in a paper by Tole et al., (1983) as a measure of cognitive loads, describing the changes of looking behaviors of eleven pilots in the conditions of different tasks. the model was also adopted in analysis of eye tracking data of car driving [ ]Xx used similar metric of “Scan path entropy” to quantify gaze guidance to a specified target.
We just follow the Tole’s definition of visual entropy based on Markov chain models.\\
Tole et al., (1983) Visual scanning behaviour and pilot workload 1983
Jess Gilland 2008 Driving, Eye-tracking and Visual Entropy\\
The saccades on a page has two classes: intra AOI and inter AOI\\
The entropy represents the uncertainty of the transition between the points of the fixations. As we knew, the number of possible positions of fixations is 1024*800, equal to the resolution of the images. That is a huge space of states. To estimate the probabilities of the transitions among those states need a very big sample set. That is impossible to get via eye tracking tests. So xx and xx’s solution was to subdivide the view into a number of areas. In this research, we take the advantage of the system-generated AOI. Then only the inter AOI transitions are taken into account.  inter AOI transitions are relative large saccades. A transition is thought to be an attention driven mechanism that requires a slight but unconscious attentional shift from the current target to peripheral target acquisition (Henderson, 1993). That is just the meaning of global exploration suggested by benyle\\
By AOI clustering, we can convert each observer’s eye movements on a page into a series of AOI jump sequences.\\

The markov nature of eye movements
If a discrete time series {x0, x1, ..., xt} satisfying P (xt + 1 | xt) = P (xt + 1 | xt, xt-1, xt-2, ..., x0), then the time series is called the Markov chain. The markov chain of AOI sequences could be simply explained that which AOI we glancing toward is only relevant to which AOI we have just gazed on.\\
For the 1st order markov chain, the total transitional probability information can be summarized by a one-step transition probability matrix.\\
In the experiment, the matrix of probability is estimated by counting all the occurrences of the transitions between the AOIs on the page. The figure xx is the probability matrix obtained from the eye movement data of the example image in fugure xx:\\

In the Matrix, pij represents the probability of transition from AOI i to AOI j.\\
Then, a visual entropy based on the 1st order markov transition matrix are calculated by the formula:\\
Definition of 1-state transition entropy:$$H = \sum_{i=1}^n(P(i)\sum_{j\neq i} p_{ij}log_2(p_{ij}))$$\\
relative entropy:$$H_{relative}~=~\frac{H}{H_{max}}$$\\
Where $p_{ij}$ represents the conditional probability of transition from AOI $i$ to AOI $j$. $p(i)$ represents the prior probability of $i$, that is, the probability of starting from X, which is obtained by counting the frequency of occurrence of X in all AOI sequences on the statistics page.
Hmax is the maximum entropy of the current AOI transitions, and the maximum entropy is obtained by supposing all transition probabilities are equal and all the prior probabilities are equal. By dividing the Hmax, the visual entropies of different pages with different numbers of AOIs are comparable to each other.

Then entropy could inform us the certainty of the attentional shifts between AOI. We expected that the entropy of a good page would have a smaller value. However, the result was disappointing. Based on the 3s eye tracking data, The correlation between the entropies and the aesthetic scores was 0.1585, and the two classes’ anova P-value is 0.4741.
