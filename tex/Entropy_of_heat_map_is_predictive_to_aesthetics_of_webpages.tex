\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Aesthetics are important factors for engaging users in browsing a website. Big data reveal that most visitors will determine whether stay on or leave a webpage in just a few seconds after landing [Weibull distribution]. Appealing webpages make visters feel more trustworthy [11, 22]. Tractinsky et al. (2000) claims that the beautiful webpages are seemingly more usable.

Aesthetic is rooted in the Greek term for "to perceive." Our vision system, the eye and the connected cortex behind, enables us to perceive and cognize the beauty around us. An eye, behaves like a spotlight [.[6] ], has a very narrow but very high-resolution foveal vision surrounded with a broader but much lower resolution peripheral area. our subtle attention mechanism determines where our spotlight move toward and upon, targeting things like faces, words, images on screens, and a variety of other meaningful objects, bringing salient details into the focus and filtering out background clutter. The spotlight keeps glancing from one spot to another and piecing all snapshots together to give an overall impression of the scene to our brain.

eye tracking devices are designed for recording our fixations (gaze) and saccades (eye movements). In usability and marketing research. Eye tracking has been used in evaluating quality of user interfaces largely to assess the accessibility of key information. Though useful, this is still a fairly limited measure of user experience [].
Is it possible to use the eye tracker as a mind reader to guess observers’ aesthetic satisfactions to a webpage? this paper gives a positive answer with some evidences that eye tracking devices do enable us some new sense of beauty in the eye of the beholder.

30 observers’ visual explorations on 40 webpages were recorded individually using an eye tracker in a normal lab circumstance. Each page was stare by one person for 3000ms, The webpages were also rated by the same group of the observers later based on their personal aesthetic judgments. Shannon entropy were introduced to analyze the eye tracking data. The result shows that the entropy of heat map (attention map), which visualizes gaze distribution, is highly correlated with the observers’ aesthetic judgements of the webpages (r=-0,65; F= 26.84, p=0.000007). This single metric alone can predict the web aesthetics to a certain degree (87.5\%). The entropy could be interpreted as an objective and quantitative metric of chaos in our attentional processes. Therefore it could be the direct evidence to the fluency hypothesis ( Reber et al), which propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver. The more fluently perceivers can process an object, the more positive their aesthetic response.

\section*{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel}
\subsection{Eye tracking and experimental aesthetics}
It is a natural thought that our eye’s attentional responses may somehow reflect our sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object.

To examine how eye movements relate to judging aesthetically pleasing works of art, Berlyne (1971) concluded that aesthetic evaluations are based on two types of visual exploration, one is global diverse exploration and the other is local specific information gathering. The diverse exploration is characterized by long saccades and short fixation (gaze) durations, while specific information gathering has longer fixation durations and shorter saccades. Berlyne proposed that the pattern of exploration, featured by the oscillation of the durations and saccade lengths, is crucial for judging images as aesthetically pleasing or not. Berlyne's concept of visual exploration gives a theoretical framework influential to the following studies in this area.

Locher(2006). Demonstrates that simply altering the color-balance of the original abstract compositions will change the distribution of gaze and scan path.

difference in the distribution of the gaze existed between the three versions of each compositioempirical evidence that affected the way viewers attention and cognitive processes that occur during an aesthetic episode visually
Franke et al. 2008 investigated people’s aesthetic preferences to the 3-D graphic rendering with single- versus multi-perspectives. A clear perceptual bias towards multi-perspective images was found. An additional eye tracking study revealed an increased number of fixations and longer dwell times on multi-perspective images.

Plumhoff and Schirillo 2009 use eye tracking to discern if unconscious eye movements were related to the phenomenon of “oblique effect” (Latto et al, 2000 Perception 29 981 \^ 987). (The effect claims that observers prefer originally oriented Mondrian's painting to their rotated versions.) They observed that with the pleasant images, the fixation durations over the viewing period are increasing and the saccade lengths are fluctuating more compared to the unpleasant.

Wallraven et al. 2009, analyzed eye tracking data from 20 participants, who looked at 275 artworks of different periods of styles, found a strong effect of art period on both number and duration of fixations. For instance, they found that Postmodernist and Classicist images received less and at the same time longer lasting fixations than the Surrealist paintings.

Massaro et al 2012 use deliberately categorized ( color, grey, human and nature) of art paintings as test material to investigate the contributions of bottom-up and top-down processes of visual attention in the first stages of eye scanning on the art paintings. They checked some extra indexes of AOI (area of interests) such as the number of AOIs, the number of fixations in first AOIs, time to first AOI and so on, besides the indexes of the number and duration of fixation.

Khalighy et.al 2015 developed an empirical aesthetic formula by conducting three eye-tracking experiments on simple geometric forms of stimuli. He conclude that beauty are positively related to the product of the number of fixations and standard deviation of duration.

The reported empirical evidences so far have revealed the potential of eye tracking in study of aesthetics. Eye tracker became a new apparatus for experimental aesthetics.

The indexes mentioned above however, are generally simple statistics of raw data. Some dependent variations observed, such as the increased number of fixations, longer duration and oscillation of saccade lengths, and so on, are hard to be interpreted from aesthetics point of view. Most conclusions remain at the phenomenon level. There is still quite few research giving us an in-depth convincing interpretation about how our eyes’ behavior connected with our aesthetic responses.

\subsection{Eye tracking and webpage aesthetics}
Researches of webpage aesthetics are mainly focusing on finding predictive features of webpage per se. For instance, the complexity []. Some progresses have made in this direction. Ivory and Sinha [16] Zheng et al. [38] reneick etal use low level image features to predict perceived visual complexity and colorfulness and find the two models are largely correlated to people’s aesthetic preferences.

Eye trackers are extensively used in webpage evaluations. The data collected, however, are only used to visualizing overviews of accessibilities or interests bias to specific objects, a pretty limited usage. The visualization and analysis tools come with eye tracker have nothing to do with the user experiences of aesthetics. Can eye tracking data provides a more general means of quantifying a viewer’s aesthetic experience? It is still a new territory, although aesthetics of webpage have been studied quite a lot.

Proven quantitative links between eye movements and aesthetics are still lacking [ ]. It may needs more deep mining of the tracking data and more informative and interpretable indexes formulated from aesthetic perspective.

\section*{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:hyp}
Our idea is derived from the fluency hypothesis. Reber et al propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties. The more fluently perceivers can process an object, the more positive their aesthetic response.
Viewing a webpage is essentially a procedure of image processing in human visual system.

How to evaluate the fluency of visual processing？It could be started from the entrance of the pipeline -- attention, which serves as a precursor to all other neurological/cognitive functions.
At its most basic, attention is defined as the process by which we select a subset from all of the available information for further processing. Attention keeps alerting and selecting targets in both bottom up (visual saliences) and top down (interesting things) ways.
If the fluency hypothesis is true, the attentional process should be also influential to our aesthetic judgements. Then, how to measure the fluency of visual attention?

Reasonably a fluent attentional process must have:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Less conflict and more easy in competitive selection, which is the process determining which visual object gains access to working memory, between multiple attention cues.
  \item Less distraction and more easy in orienting and localizing attention on an interesting and informative object.
\end{enumerate}

This paper adopts entropy as the quantitative metric to the fluency/chaos in our visual attention behaviors and inspects whether it correlated with our aesthetic judgements or not. Several existing indexes of eye tracking data are also investigated as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of this new measure.

The Entropy measure will be applied on two aspects of the eye tracking data:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Entropy of gaze plot (Saccade sequence) represents how complex and uncertain the temporal order of attentional shifts among multi-objects.
  \item Entropy of heat map (Fixation distribution) represents how noisy and deconcentrating the spatial allocation of attention on those objects.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Experiment}
\label{sec:exp}
The experiment simulates accidental landings of websites. The only unnatural part of the experiment is the form we called Time-limited Exploration. That means the experiment forces/encourages the observers to do quick general explorations rather than specific information gatherings on the pages. After three pages of adaptive testing in advance, the observers should aware that they only have a few seconds to view each of the pages displayed. This is reasonable as we already knew, users are used to making a quick decision whether stay or leave in first seconds after landing a new page, to avoid wasting more time than necessary on bad pages.

The restricted exposure time must be enough to allow us to examine the early unintentional gazing behavior, meanwhile avoids the fatigue of the observer.

\subsection{Equipment}
The eye tracker we used is a Tobii T50 that works with Tobii Studio 9 software. The eye tracker resolution is 1280 * 1024 pixel.

\subsection{Materials}
We selected 40 website main pages snapshots as the testing material. To make the webpages more representative to good or bad in aesthetic quality. We sampled pages from http://www.thebestdesigns.com/ and a site voting for ugly web designs www.websitesfromhell.com, and only selected the odd number pages in the collections.

pages that contain non-Latin characters or well recognized logos and faces were removed, to avoided interference of non-aesthetic social opinions. Finally, we got 20 webpages from each site. All pages were snapshotted in landscape form with resolution 1280*800 pixels to match the window of eye tracker. The snapshots includes the frame of web browser. figure \ref{fig:all} is all the pages used as the stimuli.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Subjects}
A total of 30 subjects (13 men, 17 women) participated in eye movement experiments. They are students or teachers from some departments in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Some of them are foreign students from South Korea. Aged between 19 and 27 years old.

\subsection{Site setting}
the experiment was conducted in a quiet room. The curtains of the room were pulled up to avoid uncontrollable light and reflection on screen. During the eye tracking, there was no interaction between the operator and the subjects. The eye tracker was placed in front of a pure White wall, to avoid possible distractions.

A subject was instructed to browse these pages in a relaxed manner, just as usual mindless wandering on the web. In order to reduce the fatigue effect, the test was divided into two phases with a minute of rest in between. In each phase, the screen of the tracker automatically displayed half of total 40 experimental pages in a random order. each page was only lighted up for 3 seconds, followed with 1 second black screen. Three dummy pages were placed at the beginning of the first phase as the adaptive test to make them feel comfortable with the rhythm of the test.

During the test the subject sat in a working chair, and was asked to rest his/her chin comfortably on a soft high support to fix his head in 60 inches distance from the eye tracker screen. The elbows rested on the table edge with a mouse in one hand, though the clicking and scrolling were not responding.

The subjective ratings of the pages were arranged separately after the experiment. The subjects reviewed the 40 experimental pages once again with no time limit. The subjects were asked to judge the aesthetic quality of "good" or "bad" for each page.

And all subjects confirmed the pages they saw in the test had never seen before.

\subsection{data collection}
Each page in the test gets a final score based on how many “good” or “bad” it have got. The figure \ref{fig:score} is the distribution of the pages on the scores.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:score}
  \centering
  \includegraphics [width=80mm]{fig_score.jpg}
  \caption{the distribution of page on scores. There are clearly two groups. The bad pages are generally are more definite, while the good pages are more differentiated.}
\end{figure}

the distribution is apparently bimodal. The 20 pages with score less than 0.5 are exactly same pages collected from the www. In other words, this 20 pages are recognized as "bad" pages without any doubt.

T50 collects the eye focus on the screen in the frequency of 50Hz, and through interpolation to get the speeds of the eye movement at all times, then to estimate where the fixation gaze happens.
The raw data produced by the eye tracker is consisted a series of gazes/fixations. Each fixation contains four parameters: the start time, the duration, position X and Y on the screen. The following analysis is just based on these eye-tracking raw data based on fixations.

\section*{Analysis}
\label{sec:ana}
\subsection{ Traditional statistical indexes}
Firstly, we check the significances of some traditional descriptive statistical indexes on the collected eye tracking data . Most of them have been used in various situations of the aesthetics researches mentioned in section \ref{sec:rel}.

The indexes we use include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item num of fixation
  \item mean of duration
  \item std of duration
  \item mean of saccade length
  \item std of saccade length
  \item num of AOI
  \item mean of AOI fixNum
  \item std of AOI fixNum
\end{itemize}

Areas of Interests (AOIs) are spatial clusters of the fixations on the pages, we uses the default AOI clustering algorithm in the Tobii Studio package. Figure \ref{fig:aoi} is an AOI example obtained by the clustering.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:aoi}
  \centering
  \includegraphics [width=70mm]{fig_eg.jpg}
  \includegraphics [width=70mm]{fig_eg_AOI.jpg}
  \caption{ above is one of the testing images. Below is the image overlapped with AOIs, which are generated using default clustering tool in Tobii studio. There are total 11 AOIs.}
\end{figure}

The results of the analysis are listed in table \ref{tab:traditional}. Each index has a linear correlation value with the aesthetic scores, and a p-value of anova test separating the good and bad two classes.

The results show that only Number of fixations is barely passed the anova test. P<0.05, all other indexes are failed in the anova test. The number of fixations has a weak positive correlation with the page aesthetics, representing the nice pages generally get more of gazes, implying the eyes are more active. Meanwhile, the Number of AOI has a week negative correlation with the page aesthetics, representing the good page’s fixations are more concentrated on fewer AOI. It may also imply subjects are more swiftly entering the stage of specific information gathering.

  \caption{the performances of some traditional statistics of fixations, saccades and AOIs. Only the number of fixations has a weak correlation with the aesthetic scores r=0.33. and the ANOVA is significant. p=0.04}
\end{table}

\subsection{Entropies in eye movements}
The existing definition of entropy includes thermodynamics and information theory, conceptual, entropy represents a system’s chaos, degree of confusion, or vice versa, order and certainty.
The concept of visual entropy actually expresses the determinism of peoples’ eye movements in spatial and temporal dimensions. A smaller visual entropy may indicate a more fluent and concentrated visual process.
The visual entropies defined in this paper a based on the Shannon entropy of information. The entropy is a measure of the uncertainty based on the probabilities of all possible events.
	For a discrete random variable X with probability spaces Ω = {x1, ..., xn} and probability distribution P (X). The information entropy H (the Greek letter eta) is defined as H (X) = -ΣP (xi) log2 P(xi). The higher the degree of H (X), the higher the degree of chaos on the distribution of X, the greater the amount of uncertainty, whereas the smaller the H (X), the more ordered the distribution of X and the smaller the amount of uncertainty.
Now we analyze the visual entropies from two aspects of the eye tracking data: large saccades (transitions) among AOIs and fixation distribution
\subsubsection{Entropy in gaze transitions}
Entropy of eye movements was first introduced in a paper by Tole et al., (1983) as a measure of cognitive loads, describing the changes of looking behaviors of eleven pilots in the conditions of different tasks. the model was also adopted in analysis of eye tracking data of car driving [ ]
Xx used similar metric of “Scan path entropy” to quantify gaze guidance to a specified target.

We just follow the Tole’s definition of visual entropy based on Markov chain models.

Tole et al., (1983) Visual scanning behaviour and pilot workload 1983
Jess Gilland 2008 Driving, Eye-tracking and Visual Entropy

The entropy represents the uncertainty of the transition between the points of the fixations. As we knew, the number of possible positions of fixations is 1024*800, equal to the resolution of the images. That is a huge space of states. To estimate the probabilities of the transitions among those states need a very big sample set. That is impossible to get via eye tracking tests. So xx and xx’s solution was to subdivide the view into a number of areas. In this research, we take the advantage of the system-generated AOI. Then only the inter AOI transitions are taken into account.  inter AOI transitions are relative large saccades. A transition is thought to be an attention driven mechanism that requires a slight but unconscious attentional shift from the current target to peripheral target acquisition (Henderson, 1993). That is just the meaning of global exploration suggested by Berlyne (1971). By AOI clustering, we can convert each observer’s eye movements on a page into a series of AOI jump sequences.

The markov nature of eye movements

If a discrete time series $X_1,X_2,X_3,...$ satisfying $P(X_{n+1}=x~|~X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,...,X_n=x_n)~=P(X_{n+1}=x~|~X_n=x_n)$, then the time series is called a discrete-time Markov chain.
The Markov property of AOI sequences could be simply explained that which AOI we glancing toward is only relevant to which AOI we have just gazed on.

For the $1^{st}$ order markov chain, the total transitional probability information can be summarized by a one-step transition probability matrix.

In the experiment, the matrix of probability is estimated by counting all the occurrences of the transitions between the AOIs on the page. The figure xx is the probability matrix obtained from the eye movement data of the example image in figure \ref{fig:aoi}:

In the Matrix, the value on row i column j represents the probability of transition from AOI i to AOI j.

Then, a visual entropy based on the $1^{st}$-order markov transition matrix are calculated by the formula:
$$H = \sum_{i=1}^n(P(i)\sum_{j\neq i} p_{ij}log_2(p_{ij}))$$\\

Where $p_{ij}$ represents the conditional probability of transition from AOI $i$ to AOI $j$. $p(i)$ represents the prior probability of $i$, that is, the probability of starting from AOI i, which is obtained by counting the frequency of occurrence of i in all AOI sequences on the statistics page.

Hmax is the maximum entropy of the current AOI numbers, and the maximum entropy is obtained by supposing all transition probabilities are equal and all the prior probabilities are equal. By dividing the Hmax, the visual entropies of different pages with different numbers of AOIs are comparable to each other：

$$H_{relative}~=~\frac{H}{H_{max}}$$

The entropy could inform us the certainty of the attentional shifts between AOI. We expected that the entropy of a good page would have a smaller value. However, the result was disappointing. Based on the 3s eye tracking data, The correlation between the entropies and the aesthetic scores was 0.1585, and the two classes’ anova P-value is 0.4741.

The failure of the entropy based on AOI markov chain might be caused by the following two reasons:
The $1^{st}$-order markov chain might be an over-simplified model. However, increasing the order of the chain requires an exponentially bigger data set.

Relevant information was lost and some errors was introduced in the clustering and the default clustering algorithm in tobii studio was not so smart enough to avoid any wrong cluster. A smarter algorithm must have the ability of object recognition.

Entropy based on markov chain regards eye movements serially-related events of eye fixations and saccades.

Here we introduce a new entropy matric based on Heat map, which is the best-known visualization technique for eye tracking studies.[35] In contrast to the gaze chain, heat map has no information about the order of gazing. That means the new entropy metric assumes all the gazing events are independent.

Heat map visualizes spatial probability distribution of fixations on a page.

Considering a two-dimensional random variable $(X, Y)$ representing the position of a fixation, the resolution of screen constitute its probability space (ie, each pixel is a possible position for a fixation).
Based on the probability distribution $p(X, Y)$, The entropy is defined as % 这里我把visual entropy --> entropy
$$VAE(p)~=-\sum_{i=1}^{1280} \sum_{j=1}^{800} p(x_i, y_j)log_2(p(x_i, y_j))$$

$p$, The probability distribution of $(X, Y)$, which is actually the heat map, is posterior and can be estimated by the eye tracking data.

The entropy of the gazemap reflects the consistency or agglomeration of the subjects’ eye movements in the space: when all the gazes concentrate on a single pixel, it obtains the smallest value, and when the gazes are evenly scattered on the screen, it gets the maximum value.
to estimate the $p(X, Y)$ with the small sample of fixations, an important technique is Gaussian Mixture, which interpolates all the fixations by placing a Gaussian kernel at each observed fixations.
% 我加的
For a single fixation $(x_0, y_0, d)$, where $x$ is the horizontal position, $y$ is the vertical position and $d$ is the duration,
The expression of the kernel is
$$d\cdot e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
Where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the kernel
Notice that the expression is not the standard normalized gauss distribution as the model will be normalized finally to make sure the total probability $\sum\sum p(X,Y) = 1 $. % 我改动了一点文字

Placing a proper size Gaussian at a fixation is also reasonably reflecting the fact that the fixation is actually a round area corresponding to the fovea. And the fixation in reality is not absolutely fixed due to the fixational movements []. The mixture model also tolerates the inevitable measure error of the eye tracker. The figure xx is a typical heat map with $\sigma=30px$

The visual entropies of 40 pages based on their heat map were turned out to be negatively correlated with their aesthetic scores. Pearson correlation r= -0.54891. Anova f=xxx p = xxxx. The results are pretty significant.
it is interesting that the weightless heat map (see figure xx), a heat map without the duration information, has even better performance than, or at least as good as the duration based heat map. Pearson correlation is -xxxx.   Anova F=16.6 with p = 0.0002. This fact may imply that the duration information has no contribution to predicting the aesthetic scores. It works like a kind of random perturbation. It is not so strange considering the fact that the duration can range greatly by individual (Green, 2002; Irwin, 1996; Zwahlen \& Schnell, 1998) from less than 100ms to well over a second depending on the situation (Harris et al, 1988).

Present results show that the visual entropy based on heat map is the most promising index to predict a web page’s aesthetic score. Heat map sometimes is also referred to as attention map. So we name this matric Visual Attention Entropy (VAE).

\subsubsection{relative VAE}
There is a defect with VAE as metric. VAE is negatively correlated with the aesthetic judgements. However, an absolutely lower VAE does not necessary mean a very high aesthetic quality. For instance, a web page with very little content may result in a very low VAE. While a web page containing many objects may have relatively high VAE. This certainly does not mean the former is better than the latter. Theoretically, the VAEs of pages with different contents are not comparable to each other.

To solve this problem, we introduced a concept called Relative VAE (R-VAE). To compare VAEs of different webpages, it is necessary to take into account their different Base VAE (B-VAE), which is supposed to be the inevitable and noise free VAE of a page. It means the page’s must pay attention resource for the contents per se. The B-VAE on the page is estimated by averaging the individual VAEs of all subjects.

$$VAE_{basic}~=~\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n VAE(p_i)$$\\

Where $H_{basic}$ is the individual VAE measured on ith subject.
With the Base VAE as a precondition, now we get the relative VAE:

Compared to VAE, The performance of Relative VAE was significantly improved, the Pearson Correlation Care increased. from r= 0.55 to r= 0.65. ANOVA F=25.88 with p-value =0.00001

The formula xx indicates that the higher the Base-VAE, the lower the Relative-VAE, therefore benefits the aesthetics. That’s not fully true, however, and in reality the higher Base-VAE may result in possibly a much higher VAE, since the two indexes are significantly correlated (r=0.7). see table \ref{tab:corr}

\label{tab:corr}

On other hand, generally a lower Base-VAE is corresponding to a lower VAE. Apparently this does not mean a lower Relative-VAE either. The analysis shows that aesthetic score is weakly correlated with Number of Fixation (r=0.33). So the good pages are generally have more fixations (interesting points). And Base-VAE is also positively correlated with Number of Fixation (r=0.59). This implies the good web pages generally are not based on lower Base-VAEs. Those facts may also explain why Base VAE has ignorable linear correlation with the aesthetic score (r=-0.11). figure \ref{fig:bvae} shows Base-VAE has no difference between the good and bad pages.

It seems that a moderate Base-VAE is more welcome. A moderate Base VAE means a proper amount of specific information the viewer has perceived. It also represents the must-pay attention resource for the visual exploration in the viewport.

\end{figure}

The introduction of Base-VAE enables us to compare VAEs of pages with different complexities of contents, and get more precise predictions to their aesthetics.

Definition of relative VAE:

$$VAE_{relative}~=~\frac{VAE}{VAE_{basic}}$$

  \caption{the box diagram of VAE (top)  and R-VAE (bottom).both are duration-free. Apparently, The R-VAE are more significantly separating the two classes.}

  \caption{the scatter plot of VAE (top) and R-VAE (bottom). Both are weightless. Apparently. The point cloud in the bottom one are more significantly skewed.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:box} and \ref{fig:with-score} shows that compared to the VAE, the Relative-VAE is more correlated with the aesthetic score. the Relative-VAE are all scattering above 1.0. The good pages are generally closer to 1.0.

\subsection{Outlier}
%%两张图片这里

By carefully comparing the two scatter plots in figure xx, we can find generally the points with higher scores (above 0.5) are slightly move left, while the points with lower scores are skewed right. Make them more separable.  There are still some misclassified cases. An extreme outlier ( see the dot with red circle in figure xx ) though has a not bad score 0.7, its VAE and R-VAE are pretty high.
Checking the original image of the page (see figure xx) on full screen, we can feel our eyes a little strained with selection pressure. So, it is seemingly not an experimental error. the R-VRE really caught the unpleasant in observers’ eyes.

Why this page got a fairly good score? We think it might be attributed to the beautiful contents. Objectively speaking, this is a not so bad webpage, especially the images are nice. But, from designer’s point of view, it still has a large room to improve. Figure xx bottom is a slightly revised version of the page.

It is no doubt that the contents of webpage are inevitably an influential factor to our attention and aesthetic cognition. VAE is not the all about webpage aesthetics. VAE is essentially more affected by bottom up low-level image features such as edge contrast or complexity.

\subsection{The stability of VAE}
Figure \ref{fig:with-t} visualizes how the VAEs of 40 pages are increasing over time. For every moment of time ti, we calculate the entropies based on the accumulated fixations during the period from t0 to ti, until i= 3000ms. Then For each of the 40 pages, we get a corresponding curve over time. All the 40 curves are fluctuating at the beginning, and gradually flattened and stabilized. In same way, Figure 4b visualizes how the R-VAE of each pages decreasing over time.

The blue curves are the good pages while the red curves are the bad pages. Apparently, the good pages generally have lower VAE and R-VAE all the time. And the two groups are more clearly separated at the end.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:with-t}
  \centering
  \includegraphics [width=80mm]{fig_vae_t.jpg}
  \includegraphics [width=80mm]{fig_rvae_t.jpg}
  \caption{The VAEs (top) and the R-VAEs (bottom) of the 40 pages are calculated over time line. The blue curves are good pages. The red curves are bad pages.}
\end{figure}

In order to optimize the performance of VAE, we traverse the correlations between the entropies and the Aesthetic scores depending on the variables of the testing time, the number of subjects and the sigma.

Figure \ref{fig:corr-t} visualizes how the correlations between the entropies and the aesthetics developing over the testing time. The correlations become significant as early as 1000ms, and keep the tendency going downwards. As we did not record the eye movements after 3s, we are not able to see the development of the correlations afterwards. They could be better, gradually going down with time until reaching their limits.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:corr-t}
  \centering
  \includegraphics [width=80mm]{fig_corr_t.jpg}
  \caption{ four curves represent VAE and R-VAE (both with and without duration weights), their correlations to the aesthetic scores developing over the time line. It is clear that R-VAEs keeps below the VAEs after 1000ms. It seems that the R-VAEs could perform better even after the 3000ms.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:with-user} visualizes how increasing number of subjects gradually stabilizes the performances of the visual entropies. They gradually become stable by enlarging the sample groups of subjects, sized 2, 3, 4… 29, which are generated by random from the total 30 subjects.
The coefficients are gradually stabilized with the increasing number of subjects and gradually converges between -0.5 and -0.6. The graph also indicates that 30 subjects might be a balance point between the precision and the costs.
The larger the number of subjects, the smaller the testing error. However, it also means more time and more money. And the accuracy of the posteriori probability gradually ceases to increase after a certain number of samplings.

  \caption{ four curves represent VAE and R-VAE (both with and without duration weights), their correlations to the aesthetic scores changing by gradually increasing the number of subjects.}
\end{figure}

Until now, all the analysis of the entropies is based on the heat map with sigma = 30px. How sensitive is the performance when the sigma’s value is changing?

The figure \ref{with-sigma} visualizes the Pearson correlations changing by the sigma. In a pretty wide range of the sigma, from 13px-60px, the correlation coefficients keep below -0.5. And the curves hava a climaxes at about 20-30px. So the entropies are not so sensitive to the size of the Gaussian.

  \centering
  \includegraphics [width=80mm]{fig_vae_sigma.jpg}
  \caption{two curves are weighted and weightless VAEs, their Pearson correlations with aesthetics changing by gradually increased sigma.}

The above analysis show the stability of the visual attention entropies in predicting our aesthetic judgements.

\section*{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:dis}
The experiment proved that our aesthetic judgments to webpages do relate to our eye movement behaviors. Shannon Entropy measure was testified on two aspects of the eye tracking data:  gaze sequence and heat map. The entropy of heat map, VAE, was proved predictive to our aesthetic judgements, while the entropy of gaze series (markov chain) was not. VAE as the entropy of visual attention can be interpreted as the chaos in allocating of our limited attentional resource. Its improved version, R-VAE has significant correlation (r=-0.65) with our perceived aesthetics. This single metric alone can predict the web aesthetics to a certain degree.

The success of VAE at least partially are attributed to the interpolation of Gaussians. The fixations in 3 seconds are all projected on a single plane and the distribution is supposed continues. The probability then can be estimated precisely using a small sample set. While the failure of the entropy of gaze sequence is possibly due to the extra temporal dimension making the data points much sparser. It is hard to conclude that temporal information is irrelevant to our aesthetic judgements so far. Maybe a better model could be found in the future to replace the markov chain to solve this problem.
A lower VAE can be interpreted as that we pay less effort in eye orienting, searching and less distracted in looking, in other word, has lower perceptual or attentional load. The evidence that aesthetically pleasing pages have lower VAEs supports the fluency hypothesis [], and somehow explains why “what is beautiful is usable” [ ]. VAE is based on the special information of eye fixations. As a new objective and quantitative index of eye tracking data, it is surely not just a matric for aesthetics. VAE in nature are more related to our perceptual and motor control ability. Eye gazing likes mouse pointing. That’s the reason why some visual design principles for eye guidance are quite similar to Fitts law [].

Relative-VAE can be interpreted as a balance between using as lower as possible VAE to perceive as much as possible useful information in the constraint of the screen. This explanation in line with the aesthetic principle “maximum effect for minimum means”[], which is rooted in the Evolutionary Aesthetics. The theory argues that the basic aesthetic preferences of Homo sapiens have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.

The eye movements is the collaborations of overt and covert attentions. Though we found that to predict a web page’s aesthetics needs at least 1000ms eye tracking data, it has been reported that our first impression of a webpage are formed as quickly as in 50-500ms [Lindgaard et al]. 50ms is barely enough for a snapshot and our eyes are still at their original positions. There is, however, no contradictory to our results. It implies that brain can make a right aesthetic judgement just based on a covert attention map which are formed by the visual residual of 50ms exposure.
